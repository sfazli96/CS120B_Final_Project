Introduction
Reflex game is a game where it will show 2 letters/characters at different times on the LED matrix and remember those characters. This reflex game shows how fast the player has to get to the letter/random characters that will appear on the Matrix. There will be two random letters/characters that will appear on the Matrix. The random letters/character can be only these certain letters/characters such as ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘X’, ‘Y’, ‘L’, ‘R’ and all the d-pad arrows as well. The rules are that the player has to remember what random letter/characters appeared on the Matrix and then it disappears. After it disappears the player has to press one of the characters on the SNES controller that exact same on the LED matrix. If you picked both characters correctly then you get a point and then the LED matrix will generate another random character. Until the player gets 5 points and then they win. If the player misses one character incorrect and the other correct then they lose a life. You have 3 lives to play the game and to win you have to get 5 points. If you lose all 3 lives then its game over and you lose.
